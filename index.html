<div><p> To start, let's talk about meat!</p>
	<h2>How does meat affect your health (pros and cons)- Zhuolun</h2>
	<p>Meat isn’t a food that’s all good and all bad, there are pros and cons to eating meat. It gives a lot of protein and important nutrients that the body needs. To start off there are different types of meat: red meat, white meat, and processed meat. Red meat comes from mammals and contains a lot of iron, types of red meat are beef, pork, and etc. White meat comes from birds and smaller animals, types of white meat are chicken, turkey, and etc. Processed meat is meat that has been changed and modified, types of processed meat is hot dogs, hamburgers, and etc. Lean meat is where most of the protein and health stuff comes from. It provides essential amino acids for the body. </p>
	<p>Cooking meat differently can cause affect the healthiness of the meat; by cooking too long, there can be an increase of toxic byproducts that can cause cancer. Well-done meat and processed meat can increase the chance of cancer; the most common cancer caused by meat is colon cancer. Meat is also linked to heart disease and diabetes. </p>
	<p>Eating meat does have many benefits, however. It can help with retention of muscle mass, give stronger bones, improve iron absorption,reduce appetite, and increase metabolism. </p>
	<p>Some people chose not to eat meat for ethical and environmental reasons, like climate change. They see industrial farms as inhumane. If you don’t think that you want to support those kinds of farms anymore, but still want to eat meat, well you could switch to alternatives, for example impossible burger. Impossible burger is regarded as something super close to meat in taste, but doesn’t harm the environment. It’s one of the most popular options right now. </p>

	<h2>Fake Meat Alternatives - Zhuolun & Kaylen</h2>
	<p>Fake Meat brands and their type of meat: </p>
	<p><b>Gold&Green:</b> Plant based meat; Gold&Green is a Finnish vegan meat brand that focuses on creating plant-based foods. They make special and unique meat that’s mostly made from oats, they don’t try to mimic real meat. They try to keep things healthy. </p>
	<p><b>Impossible Foods:</b> Probably the most famous brand that’s trying to recreate meat with plants. Their goal is to try to recreate real meat as close to as possible. They take certain aspect from different plants and combine them to recreate meat. Right now, they are the closest so far as to recreating meat. However, right now they aren’t considered very healthy. The meat they produce is very processed and has less micronutrients than real meat. </p>
	<p><b>Beyond Meat:</b> This one is also very popular, but they have more products than Impossible Foods. Most of their meats, similar to Impossible Foods, are created using plants. Parts of plants are used and combined to create a meat substitute. For example the fat could come from coconuts, protein from tofu, and etc. But unlike Impossible Foods, they aren’t receiving a lot of criticism. </p>
	<p> Fake Meats are a good replacement for meat, but they're not the most healthy option since they are very processed. </p>
	<br>
	
	<h2>Healthy alternatives to meat (that isn’t meat)- Zhuolun & Erica Williams</h2>
	<p>If you’re skeptical about fake meat, but want to become a vegan or vegetarian, here are some alternatives to meat that still gives you nutrients: </p>
	<p><b>Tofu:</b> Tofu is a good source of protein and contains a lot of essential amino acids for a person’s health. Essentially, it does all the things that meat does, expect for the bad stuff like increase cholesterol levels. Tofu doesn’t have the best flavor though, it’s very mild and lackluster. Most tofus are genetically modified, so if someone wants to avoid GM foods, they’ll have to look if the product they’re buying is certified as organic. </p>
	<p><b>Seitan:</b> Seitan is created from wheat gluten. It’s a protein dense food and has a texture similar to chicken. The taste of seitan is very mild similar to tofu. People who have celiac disease or people who has a gluten free diet should generally avoid it and look for something instead. </p>
	<p>If someone wants to find meat substitutes that are more healthy than meat, they need to be careful of the sugar, salt, saturated fats, and ect. Generally, they need to find out how processed it is, the less processed the healthier. Somethings that are harder to find from meat substitutes are iron and vitamin B-12, but some plants still contain them like tempeh, peas, and mushrooms. </p>
	<br>
	
	<h2>How can you change your diet? - Erica Williams</h2>
	<p>Now here are a few tips on how to start changing your diet from heavily based around meat to a more plant based diet. First of all, I would start slow. It’s not going to be easy to cut something out of your life completely that you may have already been so heavily reliant on. Try picking a few plant-based meals for the week and maybe try sticking to some recipes that you enjoy that already are plant based. A few options are oatmeal, pasta primavera, jacket potatoes, veggie stir fry, and bean and rice burritos. </p>
	<p>Next I would suggest cutting down the amount of meat you eat in each meal. You don’t have to completely eliminate meat from your diet right from the beginning of your journey to change your diet, just try eating less meat proportions and more plant ones. This will start training your body on eating more plant based meals compared to meat based ones.</p>
	<p>I would also recommend while shopping for foods to steer away from meat and more towards plant based foods. This makes it so while you’re at home, the only choice you’re going to have is to make something plant based. There’s also a lot of good plant based options at stores to pick from, kale chips, dairy-free milk, tempeh, and tofu are just a few of them!</p>
	<p>But lastly just keep in mind that any transition takes time. You will not be able to switch your diet from being heavily meat reliant to plant based in one night. Just taking little steps to progress will eventually eliminate meat and move us forward to helping the environment!</p>
	<br>
	
	<h2>Diets with and without Meat - Kaylen</h2>
	<p>Vegan or vegetarian diets commonly contain less saturated fats and cholesterol, which contribute to lower blood pressure, They also contain more dietary fiber, phytochemicals, vitamins and minerals. However, meat contains essential minerals. They can be found elsewhere, as mentioned on previous slides/pages, but it takes research and further effort and resources acquiring all the foods compared to just getting meat. There are vitamin supplements available as a choice as well, but they are different than organic food. It would take lots of dedication to commit to a vegan/vegetarian diet, and a lot of money. For the last reason in particular, not many people could switch their food choices even if they wanted to. </p>

	<p>Now that we've talked about what is meat, how meat affects your health, and how you can change your diet, let's talk about Farms and how they affect Climate Change.</p>
	
	<h2>What are the purpose of farms + industrial farms?- Skylar</h2>
	<p>Farming started around 12,000 years ago as a way to move from a hunter/gatherer lifestyle to a agricultural and settled lifestyle (This is known as the Neolithic Revolution). After humans began to settle permanently, agriculture became necessary for societies to grow. Since then, the human population has grown from around 5 million to over 7 billion. </p>
	<p>In a capitalistic society there are more farms because there are more humans, which makes money. Not only are there more farms, but there are bigger farms. Industrial farms are large farms that use chemical fertilizers on crops, or harmful antibiotics on animals. There are many different types of industrial farms. CAFOs are concentrated animal feeding operations, in other words, industrial farms that raise animals for food. Approximately “80 billion animals are slaughtered each year for meat.”</p>
	<p>According to the CDC, “CAFO manure contains a variety of potential contaminants. It can contain plant nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, pathogens such as E. coli, growth hormones, antibiotics, chemicals used as additives to the manure or to clean equipment, animal blood, silage leachate from corn feed, or copper sulfate used in footbaths for cows”(Hribar 2010.) </p>
	<br>
	
	<h2>How did farms become what they are today? - Zhuolun</h2>
	<p>Farms didn’t always used to be like it is today. Back in the ancient times humans taught themselves how to farm by scattering garin into dug up earth. It began with peas, lentils, and barely. They also also starting herding wild livestock (mostly goats and oxen). A lot changed during the Agricultural Revolution, humans transitioned to settlement lifestyles instead of hunting and gathering, they started raising more animals like pigs, sheep, and cattle. </p>
	<p>When the New World was discovered, an influx of plants and animals was transferred to and from Europe. Farmland expanded significantly in the Americas for generations to raise more livestock and vegetables. News plants and animals were also introduced to farming. The Industrial Revolution also changed farming significantly. A mechanized approach to farming began. New equipment and techniques led to increased food production. It was also during this time that the population started to increase exponentially causing the food industry to form. </p>
	<p>Today, a lot of land is just dedicated to farming, and technology is improving causing increased food production. But a lot of additives and preservatives are being added into food causing less natural growing methods and more synthetic options. Selective breeding of livestocks are also a thing, but it has existed for thousands of years already. These selective breeding are increasing the population of livestocks. Livestock facilities are created to store all the livestocks, they are automated to suit the animals’ needs, but they are cramped so that more livestock can fit. </p>
	<br>
	
	<h2>How do farms affect the environment? - Grace</h2>
	<p>Greenhouse gasses, which are essentially bodily gases released from livestock, emit copious amounts of co2 into earth’s atmosphere. Because of co2’s heat-trapping properties this has caused temperatures around the globe to rise.The co2 produced from livestock is a massive contributor to the issue of global warming and the rate at which we consume meat and dairy products is becoming increasingly more unsustainable. </p>
	<p>As the population increases and the demand for meat and dairy products increase with it, the more space is required for raising livestock. Cows require wide patches of grassy space to graze and thousands of gallons of water to grow large enough to be slaughtered. As a result of this billions of trees are cut daily to make space for livestock, which only worsens the issue of global warming.</p>
	<p>People are essentially in the dark when it comes to how meat and dairy contribute to global warming, and the meat and dairy industry ensure the government keeps it that way. Most Americans are taught to believe meat and dairy are essential in your diet to intake the proper nutrients because of the mass profit the government makes from the meat and dairy industry. </p>

	<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220182815im_/http://www.farmingfutures.org.uk/sites/default/files/uploads/diagrams/carbon-cycle.gif" alt="Carbon Cycle" title="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/1196337376876117/" width="500" height="500"></p>
	<br>
	
	<h2>How do livestock release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere? - Zhuolun</h2>
	<p>Farming produces 3 main types of greenhouse gases, they are nitrous oxide, methane, and carbon dioxide. Methane is a very powerful greenhouse gas and is up to 30 times more damaging than carbon dioxide, but it disappears in the atmosphere quicker than carbon dioxide. Livestocks produce Methane via ‘ruminant enteric fermentation’. The gas is released when livestocks burp or fart due to the bacteria in the  sheep’s and cow’s stomach. Methane emissions from livestocks vary due to the different feeding regimes and types of foods they eat. Methane is also produced from manure. </p>
	<p>Livestocks also need significant amounts of natural resources to be sustained. Producing food for the livestock takes a lot of water and creates more greenhouse gases like nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide. Nitrous oxide is produced from manure and fertiliser use. Growing more crops for both humans and animals dramatically increase the amount of emission. Carbon dioxide is produced from maintaining the farm. Disturbing soil and Land use change are a large source of carbon emission. Most of the machinery used in farms require fuel like oil and coal which releases lots of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere when burned. Nitrous oxide is over 300 times more harmful than carbon dioxide, but carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for around 100 years. </p>
	<br>
	
	<h2>How are livestocks kept in livestock facilities and why are they bad - Tara</h2>
	<p>The majority of animals used for food are raised on factory farms. They live in poor, crowded conditions. When it’s time to slaughter them, animals are killed in cruel ways (such as bleeding or suffocation), often being fully conscious or painfully stunned (beaten or shocked with electricity). Workers sometimes abuse them before their death, for what reason I doubt any normal person could understand, but many workers have reported seeing such things or even doing them. Not to mention, they arrive to the slaughterhouse hungry, tired, and afraid. Theoretically this could be done more ethically, but it wouldn’t be time and cost effective that way. </p>
	<p>Although it is widely believed that products like milk, cheese, and eggs don’t require the slaughter of animals, and they lead to less death than products like meat and fur, these vegetarian products do still lead to slaughter. Younger animals produce more milk, eggs, cheese, etc, and in order to make room for those younger animals, older ones are killed. </p>
	<br>
	
	<h2>Why does the meat industry allow farms to run that way - Tara</h2>
	<p>The US meat industry began during colonial times. They needed meat to eat and quickly began trading with the West Indies. To carry out this trade efficiently, efficient ways to pack meat had to be created. In other words, farms run this way because it is cheaper. Being ethical is costly and slow. Large but incredibly crowded farms house animals because they don’t have to be comfortable to produce meat. Animal abuse also goes on in farms, from the workers, because animals can’t fend for themselves. They can’t fend for themselves. The only defense they have are the undercover activists that usually stay anonymous and become employed at a meat farm. They can help build cases for the animals and otherwise expose the horrors of the industry. </p>

	<h2>What can people do to help raise awareness for livestocks - Tara</h2>
	<p>As with any cause, there are plenty of ways to raise awareness for the treatment of farm animals. You can join or even host educational events, online or in person, as one way to help. The biggest issue is that the meat industry gets away with it: most people don’t know how bad it is. Even if you can’t participate in clubs or events, inform the people around you and have conversations about the issue. Make sure to do research and let people know what you find. Social media is a very good way to raise awareness on different topics, so making infographics and things of the sort is a good way to go. </p>
